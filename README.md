# yelpish

yelpish is a web application built using MERN stack. It uses the Yelp API to search restaurants near a user's location and JWT authentication to verify users' credentials. Logged in users can like a restaurant and view their list of favorites in their profile page. On load, your browser should prompt you to allow access to your current location; otherwise, you can just type in your location into the input field.
